Question,Option 1,Option 2,Option 3,Option 4,Option 5,Answer
Lactate is produced during muscle contraction:,when the cell contracts under oxygenated conditions,when there is a shortage of oxygen supply.,during anoxic conditions.,other.,all of the above.,all of the above.
Lactate produced during muscle contraction:,is a “dead end” waste product.,is a “dead end” waste product that causes fatigue.,"will produce lactate ions, which cause fatigue.",is an important energy-yielding substrate.,does none of the above,is an important energy-yielding substrate.
"To maximize “fat” loss during exercise, it is necessary to exercise at the intensity at which fat oxidation will be highest. For a sedentary individual, this typically occurs at:",<45% V̇o2max.,46-54% V̇o2max.,66-75% V̇o2max.,>75% V̇o2max.,55-65% V̇o2max,55-65% V̇o2max
"During prolonged exercise, skeletal muscle will predominantly use fat as an energy source when:",there is reduced carbohydrate availablity due to depletion of muscle glycogen stores.,there is reduced carbohydrate availability due to depletion of blood glucose stores.,there is reduced carbohydrate availability due to both of the above.,there is an increased availability of fatty acids within the muscle.,all of the above,there is an increased availability of fatty acids within the muscle.
The process of muscle contraction begins with:,propagation of an action potential along the sarcolemma.,acetylcholine transport across the synaptic cleft.,calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.,calcium binding to troponin C.,other,other
"During muscle contration, when the muscle is shortining in length, the A-band will:",shorten,lengthen,twist,remain unchanged,other,remain unchanged
The most important predictor of endurance running performance is:,,,,,,
An oxidation reaction consists of:,gain of an electron by an oxygen molecule.,loss of an electron from an oxygen molecule.,gain of an electron from any biological substance.,loss of an electron from any biological substance,other,loss of an electron from any biological substance
"During prolonged continous exercise, blood pressure will initially increase (within the first 10 min) above resting levels and should remain constant at the “exercise pressure” thereafter. When a subject is nearing the end of his run on a hot afternoon (30°C), which induces significant dehydration, his blood pressure will therefore:	",remain constant at the initially acquired exercise pressure,increase to above the initially acquired exercise pressure.,decrease to below the initially acquired exercsie pressure but remain above resting levels.,None of the above,Two of the above,decrease to below the initially acquired exercsie pressure but remain above resting levels.
